## Introduction

This assignment focuses on leveraging code modules and the `import`/`export` features of JavaScript.

## Objectives

- Create modular code using the `export` keyword.
- Use modular code using the `import` keyword.

## Submission

Submit your completed lab using the **Start Assignment** button on the assignment page in Canvas.

**Your submission should include:**

- A GitHub link to your completed project repository.

## Instructions

This very simple assignment has one goal: **to modularize pre-existing code** for better organization and future use. You will be using pre-existing code from **previous projects of your choice**.

### Getting Started

1. Select **at least two** of your past projects to work with (pick your favorites, or ones you would like to revisit).
2. Your selections should be **reasonably large** so that they can be broken up naturally into smaller parts (modules).

> 💡 **Commit frequently!** Every time something works, you should commit it.

## Modularizing Code

Production applications are never made from a single file, because doing so would be a nightmare to scale and maintain. Imagine hundreds of thousands of lines of code in a single JavaScript file...

Programmers pack their code into modules to mitigate this issue. You already have experience with at least one code module — **Axios** — and as you continue exploring JavaScript, you will learn that there are **millions** of pre-packaged modules and code libraries available.

> 💡 **This is how development scales.** Programmers build upon the work of others, saving time and energy. Why spend time recreating the functions Axios provides, when Axios already does them?

### Your Task

Using the `export` and `import` statements:

1. **Reorganize** the projects you have selected into module files.
2. Once complete, you should have:
   - Files that **export** certain features of your application.
   - Other files that **import** those features for use.
3. The files that export features can be **reused in future applications** wherever their code is relevant!
